# Streamlit Data Analysis with PandasAI and Meta Llama 3 Model

This project is a simple web application for data analysis using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [PandasAI](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai), integrating the Meta Llama 3 language model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Users can upload CSV or XLSX files and interact with the data through natural language queries.

## Features

- Upload CSV or Excel (XLSX) files.
- View the first few rows of your dataset.
- Ask questions about the data in natural language using the Llama 3 model.
- Receive answers in real-time using the `pandasai` library.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenklinov/Streamlit-CSV-excel-xlsx-Llama3-Ollama-PandasAI.git
cd Streamlit-CSV-excel-xlsx-Llama3-Ollama-PandasAI
```

2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Set up Meta Llama 3 with Ollama**: Install and configure [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to run Llama 3 locally. Ensure the model is running on ```http://localhost:11434/v1``` for this application to connect successfully.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit application**: Open PowerShell (or Terminal), navigate to the project directory, and run:
```bash
streamlit run app2.py
```

2. **Upload Data Files**:
- After launching, use the "Upload your CSV or XLSX files" button to upload one or more data files.
- Select a file from the dropdown to load its data.

3. **Interact with Your Data**:
- Type a question about the data into the provided text area.
- Click "Ask" to receive a response generated by Llama 3 through the ```pandasai``` library.

## Requirements
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [PandasAI](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai)
- Meta Llama 3 model (configured via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/))

## Example
1. Upload your data file (CSV or Excel).
2. Type in queries like:
- "What is the average value in the column 'Price'?"
- "Show the rows where 'Quantity' is greater than 50."
